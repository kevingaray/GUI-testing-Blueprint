# GUI-testing-Blueprint
This repository serves as an addition to the organization's project originally hosted privately in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dam24/GUI-testing). Here, you will find comprehensive information and resources that provide valuable context for the project.
## About
The GUI-testing Blueprint project was developed as part of the QA Automation Bootcamp. It focuses on performing comprehensive testing related to Blueprint, an internal application property of Jalasoft that allows users to create workflows business processes. This service provides a graphical interface that allows users to design workflows by connecting different steps and actions.

To ensure efficient and agile testing practices, we used [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/es/software/jira) to define the sprints and keep a track of the task

To automate and streamline the testing process, we set [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Jobs to run the test automatically every day at certain hour and with different resolutions.

## Testing Techniques
- Included
  - Acceptance testing
  - Functional testing
  - E2E testing
  - Boundary Testing
- Not included
  -  Non-functional testing (stress,load,performance)

## Conventions
- Python: When naming classes, PascalCase is used. For methods and variables, snake_case is employed
- Robot: snake_case for variables, and test titles with each first of all words letter capitalize , and should include tags
